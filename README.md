# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
This portfolio showcases data analysis and visualizations done by me, both in academic and work related context. While the datasets are not provided due to either their non-public availability or the requirement of special permission for access, I cite the sources of the data in each case. 

In this folder you can find the following documents:
- **Basic visualization in R:** data visualizations in R using ggplot. The data used for the visualizations are from the European Social Survey round 13. The objective of this file is to showcase the code of basic data vizualization done in R.
- **Basic visualization in Power BI:**  data visualization using the European Social Survey in Power BI. The objective of this file is to showcase a mock dashboard in Power BI using survey data.
- **Master thesis:** code for the data manipulation, visualization and analysis used to write my master's thesis "High risk migration via the Central Mediterranean: understanding causes of flight and gender heterogeneity".
- **Applied logistic regression:** code for data analysis using applied logistic regression.
- **Fixed effects regression:**
