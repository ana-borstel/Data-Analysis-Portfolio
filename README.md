# Data Analysis Portfolio
This portfolio showcases data analysis, manipulation and visualizations done by me, both in academic and work related context. While the datasets are not provided due to either their non-public availability or the requirement of special permission for access, I cite the sources of the data in each case. Additionally, I make available the R scripts in R Markdown html format to facilitate the visualization of results. For that, download the html files and open them in your computer.

In this folder you can find the following documents:
- **Basic visualization in R:** data visualizations in R using ggplot. The data used for the visualizations are from the European Social Survey round 13. The objective of this file is to showcase the code of basic data vizualization done in R.
- **Basic visualization in Power BI:**  data visualization using the European Social Survey in Power BI. The objective of this file is to showcase a mock dashboard in Power BI using survey data.
- **Master thesis:** code for the data manipulation, visualization and analysis used to write my master's thesis "High risk migration via the Central Mediterranean: understanding causes of flight and gender heterogeneity". Data available under request.
- **Logistic regression:** data analysis using logistic regression. This analysis was done as a final project for the class "Applied Logistic Regression".
- **Fixed effects regression**
- **Survival analysis**
- **Instrumental variable:** replication of a published paper using instrumental variable. This analysis was done as a final project of the Statistics II class for my master's degree.
- **Merge datasets using non-exact match**
